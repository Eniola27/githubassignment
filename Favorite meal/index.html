    <h3>About Yam-porridge</h3>
    <p>
        Yam porridge is very simple, quick and easy to make delicacy.
        It is delish and very filling,It can be called pottage just like Plantain Porridge/Plantain Pottage,but they are more commonly called porridge.
        Yam Porridge can be served at breakfast,lunch or dinner. In fact in typical Nigerian style, when there are tens of people sleeping over, during weddings, burials etc.
        When the yams are mature and newly harvested,they make for soft and creamy yam porridge but not very sweet.At the end of the season,when yams are old and dry,they are sweet but would not give creamy yam porridge. You will need to cook it for a very long time to achieve any sort of softness and creaminess. Mid-season yam gives the best yam porridge, combining both sweetness and creaminess.
